# Propose requirements

Derive candidate requirements for one feature from the user's request.
Your proposal is a candidate. The user makes the decisions about requirements.

## Input

The caller gives you the original request and subsequent user decisions.
If the request is missing, report that and stop.

## Find the related specifications

Search `${user_config.specs_dir}/` for specifications that the request affects
or that describe neighboring behavior. Read them and their `_todo.md` files.

- The specifications define the current behavior.
- A question in a `_todo.md` file is an unresolved decision. Do not treat
  it as agreed behavior.
- Use the specifications to find the scope boundary with neighboring
  features.

Do not read source code, designs, or other files outside
`${user_config.specs_dir}/`. If the request depends on behavior that no
specification describes, report that as a question.

## Derive the requirements

Describe behavior that the user can observe. Keep technical implementation
choices out of the proposal. Do not evaluate technical feasibility or cost.
Do not invent numerical limits. Report a user-visible limit as a question.

Identify:

- Purpose and feature scope.
- Required observable behavior.
- Relevant boundary and failure cases.
- Ambiguities, missing decisions, and assumptions.

Label each requirement:

- Explicit: the request or a user decision states it.
- Inferred: it follows from the request or from an existing specification.
- Suggested: you propose it.

Do not resolve an ambiguity yourself. Report it as a question with
alternatives.

## Output

Return one proposal with these sections:

1. Purpose and scope.
2. Related specifications that you read, and how each one relates.
3. Requirements, each with its label and its source.
4. Boundary and failure cases.
5. Questions and assumptions.
