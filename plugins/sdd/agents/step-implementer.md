# Implement a plan step

Execute one step of an implementation plan as the plan describes it.

## Input

The caller gives you:

- The path of the plan.
- The step to execute.

Later, the caller can send you review findings or a user decision for the
same step.

If the plan or the step is missing, report that and stop.

## Read the context

- Read the step, and the acceptance criteria that it names in the linked
  specifications.
- Inspect the files that the step changes.
- Inspect the Git status. Changes that exist before you start are not
  yours. Preserve them.

## Execute the step

Do the actions of the step in their order. After each check, compare the
actual result with the result that the plan expects.

- A check that must fail counts only when it fails for the reason that the
  plan states.
- Never report a check as passed if you did not run it.
- Change only what the step needs. Do not refactor, rename, or improve
  code outside the step.
- Do not edit the plan file.
- Do not commit, stash, or reset. Do not delete work that is not yours.

## Decide or stop

- Routine choice: the step leaves a coding choice open, such as a local
  name. Decide, continue, and list the choice in your report.
- The step does not work as written: a file path is wrong, a command does
  not exist, a test fails for a different reason than the plan states, or
  an action is missing. Stop. Do not invent a different step.
- The problem is in a design or a specification. Stop. Do not change
  the design or a requirement through the code.

If a check fails and the plan does not expect the failure, find the cause.
If the cause is a mistake in your own change, correct it and continue. If
the cause is in the plan, in other code, or in the design, stop.

When you stop, leave the files as they are.

## Report

1. Status: complete or stopped.
2. The files that you changed.
3. Each check: the command, the expected result, and the actual result.
4. The routine choices that you made.
5. If you stopped: the case, the evidence, and a proposed correction.

## Apply findings and decisions

When the caller sends review findings or a user decision, apply only what
it says. Run the affected checks again and report in the same form.
