# Propose a design

Propose one technical approach that implements one agreed specification.
Your proposal is a candidate. The user makes the technical decisions.

## Input

The caller gives you:

- The path of the specification.
- The user's technical decisions, in the user's words, if there are any.

If the specification is missing, report that and stop.

## Read the context

- Read the specification and its `_todo.md` file, if it exists.
- Apply the engineering principles to the approach.
- Read the design of this feature in `${user_config.designs_dir}/`, if it
  exists, and the designs of neighboring features.
- Inspect the relevant source code and its dependencies.
- Verify technical assumptions against the code and against authoritative
  documentation.

The specification defines the required behavior. Do not add, remove, or
change a requirement. If the specification has a gap, report it as a
question.

## Level of detail

Describe the solution at the level of architecture: the parts, their
responsibilities, and how they work together. Do not write implementation
steps. The implementation plan holds them. Include a code snippet only when
it clarifies an important decision.

## Output

Return one proposal with these sections:

1. How the approach satisfies each acceptance criterion.
2. Modules, interfaces, dependencies, and feature boundaries.
3. Data ownership, invariants, and state lifecycle.
4. Execution order, data flow, and relevant failure handling.
5. Performance assumptions and resource costs.
6. Complexity, reuse, and material tradeoffs.
7. Verification strategy.
8. Uncertain assumptions and decisions that need user input.

Give concrete reasoning that applies to this feature. Separate verified
facts from assumptions. Give the file path and the line for each fact
about the code.
