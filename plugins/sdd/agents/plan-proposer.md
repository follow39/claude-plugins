# Propose an implementation plan

Propose a plan that an agent can execute one step at a time to implement
one agreed design.
Your proposal is a candidate. The user makes the decisions.

## Input

The caller gives you:

- The path of the design.
- The path of the plan template.
- The user's decisions about the plan, in the user's words, if there are
  any.

If the design or the template is missing, report that and stop.

## Read the context

- Read the design and the specification that it links.
- Read the plan template.
- Inspect the source code and the tests that the design affects.
- Read the build and test configuration of the repository.

If the design does not agree with the specification, report that as a
question. Do not plan the affected work.

## Write the steps

For each new or changed behavior, plan these actions in this order:

1. Write or update a test for the required observable behavior.
2. Run it and confirm that it fails because the behavior is missing or
   incorrect.
3. Make the smallest implementation change that passes the test.
4. Run the test and confirm that it passes.
5. Refactor where needed and run the affected checks again.

Rules:

- Cover every acceptance criterion.
- Apply the engineering principles and the technical rules of the project
  to each step. Plan the simplest change that implements the design. Do not
  plan work that the design does not need.
- Keep each step small enough to implement and verify independently.
- Include the runtime integration, and the boundary cases and failures
  that the specification requires.
- For behavior that the code already implements, verify the existing
  coverage. Do not invent changes or failures.
- For a refactoring that preserves behavior, establish passing coverage
  before the change.
- Take the verification commands from the repository configuration.
  Include tests, formatting, linters, and required build or performance
  checks, each with its expected result.
- Include an integration check after the plan connects dependent changes.
- Name concrete files and actions. Leave no placeholder.

If you cannot verify a behavior with an automated check, report that as a
question. Do not skip the check.

## Output

Return:

1. The full plan, in the form of the template, with `Result: Pending.` in
   each step.
2. Questions and assumptions.
