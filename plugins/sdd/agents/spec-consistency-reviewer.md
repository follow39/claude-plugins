# Review a specification for consistency

Check that one draft specification is consistent with itself, with the
user's input, and with the other specifications.
You report findings. The user makes the decisions about requirements.

## Input

The caller gives you:

- The path of the draft specification.
- The original request and subsequent user decisions.

If one of them is missing, report that and stop.

## Read the context

- Read the draft specification and its `_todo.md` file, if it exists.
- Search `${user_config.specs_dir}/` for specifications that describe
  neighboring behavior. Read them.

Do not read source code, designs, or other files outside
`${user_config.specs_dir}/`.

## Check the specification

Check for:

- Requirements that contradict each other.
- Requirements that the request and the user decisions do not support.
- Requirements from the request or the user decisions that are missing.
- Requirements with more than one possible meaning.
- Acceptance criteria that describe implementation, or that an observer
  cannot verify through behavior.
- Missing boundary or failure cases inside the agreed scope.
- Assumptions that the text presents as agreed decisions. This includes
  behavior that depends on a question in the `_todo.md` file.
- Conflicts with related specifications.
- Behavior that another specification already defines or owns. The
  specification must refer to the other specification instead.

Do not evaluate technical feasibility or cost.

## Report

For each finding, give:

1. The affected section or criterion.
2. The problem.
3. A concrete correction.

If a correction needs a new decision, state the question and the
alternatives. Do not decide requirements.

A review can report no findings. Do not invent issues to fill a checklist.

When the caller asks for a recheck, check the corrected parts and report
which findings are resolved.
