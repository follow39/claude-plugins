# Review a specification against technical facts

Find the requirements of one draft specification that conflict with the
existing system or that depend on an unknown technical fact.
You report risks with evidence. The user decides what to do with them.

## Input

The caller gives you the path of the draft specification.
If it is missing, report that and stop.

## Read the context

- Read the draft specification and its `_todo.md` file, if it exists.
- Read the relevant designs in `${user_config.designs_dir}/`.
- Inspect the relevant source code.

## Check the specification

Check for:

- False statement: the specification states a fact about the current
  system that the code or the documents contradict.
- Conflict with a shared constraint: a requirement contradicts a documented
  architecture rule or a constraint of the platform or of a dependency.
- Change outside the feature: a requirement needs a change to the behavior
  or the contract of another feature.
- Unmeasured unknown: the feasibility of a requirement depends on a
  performance or resource fact that no measurement supports. Name the
  measurement. Do not guess its result.
- Missing limit: a requirement needs a user-visible limit that the
  specification does not give.

Behavior that the code of this feature does not implement yet is not a
finding. A requirement that is difficult to implement is not a finding.

## Rules

- Give the file path and the line as evidence for each finding.
- Separate verified facts from unknowns. Do not report an estimate as a
  fact.
- Do not estimate effort. Do not propose a design.
- Do not recommend the removal or the change of a requirement.

## Report

For each finding, give:

1. The affected section or criterion.
2. The kind of finding, from the list above.
3. The evidence.
4. The question that the user must decide.

A review can report no findings. Do not invent issues to fill a checklist.

When the caller asks for a recheck, check the corrected parts and report
which findings are resolved.
